# JavaFX-logging-Spring-MongoDB-tutorial
JavaFX Logging Application with using Spring Data with MongoDB (using Spring Boot)

Improve your applications Java Logging capabilities by adding a powerful combination to your stack; MongoDB and Spring.
The tutorial showcases MongoDB's Asynchronous & Synchronous API as well as Spring Data's MongoTemplate.

Take advantage of advanced log filtering queries via Spring Data's Query and Criteria API for mongodb which will actually yield meaningful results when performing investigations. No more grep'ing hell on the command line or developing custom shell scripts to extract time ranges to get the info your after in rolling log files.

I'll show you how to mimic a rolling file appended in mongoDB via the use of capped collections and explain how to easily get Spring's MongoTemplate dependency injected into your JavaFX controller in order to run and find all you log records. 

Although the GUI is written in JavaFX, you can take this concept
over to any other type of Java application. 
This is not your regular boring java logging tutorial! Time to put a different spin on logging.

*** You will need to have a locally running mongoDB instance running on port 27107 before running the application ***
